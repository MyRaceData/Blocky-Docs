This is the built in cron expression builder, which makes creating a cron expression really easy. Notice there are tabs for Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Month and Years at the top. In the photo, we are in the seconds tab. If it is not already selected, click on the third button down, Specific second (choose one or many). Then click on the Minutes tab
