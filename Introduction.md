# Introduction
With the release of openHAB 3 in December 2020 this open source home automation solution took a huge step towards being more user friendly. With openHAB 3 came a brand new graphic user interface that not only could be used to control home automation devices but also fully configure and administer the system. Almost every setting and configuration can be made using this simple and intuitive design. The new interface is sleek, modern and highly customizable. With all the excitement surrounding the new user interface, it was easy to miss the inclusion of another feature that made it's debut in openHAB 3. Blockly, a visual programming language was also included in openHAB 3.
## What is Blockly?
Like openHAB itself, Blockly is open source software. Blockly is a visual programming language and program editor that can be used to create computer programming code using only a graphic interface. The user is not required to have any knowledge of the programming language the editor creates the code in. The user is also not required to write any program code manually what so ever. In fact, this tool can be used by people with no computer programming experience. The code is created by dragging visual blocks that link together in a graphic workspace using drag and drop. 
## What can Blockly do?
The way Blockly is implemented in openHAB, it can be used to write scripts that can be used to create automations that run inside openHAB. With the new graphic user interface introduced in openHAB 3 and other new features, many simple automations can be created with out requiring any scripting or programming. Creating more complex automations however traditionally has required some form of actual program coding. All that changed with the introduction of Blockly in openHAB. Now a user with no computer programming skills can create elaborate home automation solutions.
## How does Blockly work?
The graphic user interface for Blockly consist of a toolbox with all the available blocks and a workspace where the program is built. The user can select blocks from the toolbox by grabbing them and dragging them into the workspace. Once in the workspace, the blocks can be arranged and linked together to form the program flow. Here is a picture of the interface, the toolbox is on the left and the large white area on the right is the workspace.

## Rules...
As a complete home automation solution, openHAB works with many popular home automation products as well as DIY devices. Using add-ons (called bindings) openHAB can be linked to these devices, and used to control them. Home automation is not just about controlling these devices however, home automation is about automating the devices. Automation is making the devices work automatically, with no human intervention or direct control. A simple example would be using a motion sensor to turn a light on when someone enters a room. In openHAB such automations can be created using what are called **Rules**. A rule is a sequence of steps which can be described as follows, if a certain event occurs (called a trigger) then some action takes place. Using the new graphic user interface in openHAB 3 users can create rules with a few clicks. Creating a home automation system however is rarely that simple. What if when someone walks in a room triggering the motion sensor, we want the light to come on at a different brightness level depending on the time of day, because the room is a bathroom and when you get out of bed in the middle of the night, you don't want the light to blind you for instance. This requires the system
