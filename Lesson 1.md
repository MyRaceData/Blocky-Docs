# Blocky Lesson 2
If you have not done so, read the first lesson in this series to learn how to create your first rule. 

If you followed the first lesson, your should see your new rule in the **Setting ----> Rules**

![rule in list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25418996/137604777-d870bb88-47f4-4bcc-a7a9-404f34e5c559.png)

You should be able to see a log entry every minute if your rule is functioning properly. We are now going to learn to do something more useful with rules. The first rule really was just to get the hang of creating a rule and actually just spams the log with messages so you may want to disable it or remove it. To do so, from the screen above, click **Select** in the upper right corner.

A selection box will appear next to all your rules. Click a rule to select it

And three buttons will appear across the bottom of the screen. You may then remove, disable or enable rules.
